ToyAppProject
=============

This project is a display of geocoding, google maps and fragment interactions.

This project relies on an api that was given by a college lecturer, the api may no longer be accessible but the source hopefully will still be helpful.

The interface is reflective and changes shape and dimensions based on the tablet / phone device.

There is a list of countries and a map to display the countries and counties/areas within the country.
